# SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project 🚀

This repository documents a comprehensive project that establishes a modern **Data Warehouse** and **Analytics** solution using **SQL Server**. It demonstrates end-to-end data engineering practices, from initial data ingestion to the creation of analytical data models for business intelligence.

-----

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture: Medallion Framework

The data architecture is structured using the **Medallion Architecture**, a multi-layered approach designed to ensure data quality and utility:

1.  **Bronze Layer (Raw Data):**
      * **Purpose:** Stores raw, unvalidated data directly ingested from source systems.
      * **Ingestion:** Data is loaded from **CSV files** into the SQL Server database.
      * **State:** Data is kept in its original format.
2.  **Silver Layer (Cleansed and Conformed Data):**
      * **Purpose:** Applies data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare data for reliable analysis.
      * **Processes:** Focuses on resolving **data quality issues** and integrating data sources.
3.  **Gold Layer (Curated and Business-Ready Data):**
      * **Purpose:** Houses final, high-value data structured for business reporting and analytics.
      * **Modeling:** Data is organized into a **Star Schema** (Fact and Dimension tables) optimized for fast analytical queries.

## 📖 Project Scope and Methodology

This project encompasses the following core technical phases:

1.  **Data Architecture Design:** Implementing the layered Medallion architecture within a SQL Server environment.
2.  **ETL Pipelines:** Developing **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** processes to move data between the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
3.  **Data Modeling:** Creating robust **Fact and Dimension tables** for efficient analytical reporting.
4.  **Analytics & Reporting:** Developing and executing **SQL-based queries** to generate key business insights.

## 🚀 Project Requirements and Deliverables

### 1. Data Engineering (Data Warehouse Build)

**Objective:** Develop a SQL Server data warehouse to consolidate sales data from disparate sources into a unified analytical model.

**Specifications:**

  * **Data Sources:** Integrate data from two distinct source systems (**ERP** and **CRM**), provided initially as flat files (CSV).
  * **Data Quality:** Implement processes to cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to data analysis.
  * **Data Integration:** Combine data from both source systems into a single, cohesive, and user-friendly data model.
  * **Scope:** The focus is on consolidating the **latest dataset**; **data historization** (Type 2 SCDs) is **not required**.
  * **Documentation:** Provide detailed **data model documentation** (e.g., entity-relationship diagrams, metadata).

### 2. Business Intelligence (Analytics & Reporting)

**Objective:** Generate detailed, SQL-based analytical insights to drive strategic decision-making.

**Deliverables (Analytical Focus):**

  * Metrics and reports concerning **Customer Behavior**.
  * Metrics and reports concerning **Product Performance**.
  * Metrics and reports concerning **Sales Trends**.
